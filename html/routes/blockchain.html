                                        FTT is a Public Blockchain connecting all major crypto currencies<br>
                                        <Br>
                                        FTT is on block <strong>{{!getBlocknumber() ? 0 : getBlocknumber() | number}}</strong>.
                                        We show the last 3 digits in the navigation bar at the top of your screen.<br>

                                            <li><strong>Base currency is US Dollars</strong><br> 
                                                Easy to know what things cost<br><br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Major crypto currencies are tokenized</strong><br>
                                                Like a checking account, users can import/export to FTT only what is needed. Once imported users get cheaper and faster transactions than using the native BitCoin/Ether/etc blockchains.<br><br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Accounting of tokinization is done via smart contract</strong><br>
                                                 Community can verify digital assets that are imported/exported during tokenization process. This real-time smart-contract based accounting system prevents fraud.<br><br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Anyone can publish solidity smart contracts</strong><br>
                                                Similar to an App-Store. Simple templates for non-developers to quickly use DLT for their business needs. Advanced tools for engineers. Speed up development process with CI/CD integration. Focus on code instead of platform infrastructure.<br><br></li>
                                            <li><strong>No need for complex blockchain tools</strong><br>
                                                Users interact with FTT using phone or browser. Simple and easy to use interface.<br><Br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Gas that runs smart contracts is totally free</strong><br>
                                                This makes it economically practical to develop micro services and services for 3rd world. Fees are set by smart contracts. This way pricing can be based on industry and use case.<br><Br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Transaction happen approximately every second</strong><br>
                                                Users demand fast response time. Currently supports 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). Can scale much higher as demand grows.<br><Br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Trigger off-chain actions based on smart contract</strong><br>
                                                Smart contracts can trigger external APIs. Send text, email, update database, trigger lambda, etc etc.<br><Br></li>
                                            <li><strong>Execute smart contract based on real world events</strong><br>

                                            Yes. All transactions are encrypted clientside with your account/key pair.
                                            Because encryption happens on the client, your secure data never travels unencrypted over the internet. 
                                            Your secure data is always encrypted when stored.

                                            A pass phrase is a group of random words.
                                            The pass phrase unlocks your CryptoPass. Keep it secret and secure.
                                            If someone knows or guesses your pass phrase they can use your CryptoPass.

                                            If a passphrase is lost, it is lost forever.
                                            The most secure thing is to protect your own passphrase.

                                            We offer an optional service to store your passphrase in our digital vault. 
                                            This way the pass phrase can be recovered.
                                            We also allow you to name a beneficiary.

                                            Our goal is to build a central crypto platform that other engineers can build on top of.

                                            Our code is Token Sourced. This means the license to the code is owned by FTT token holders. 
                                            Tokens go to FinTechToken GitHub contributors. Tokens also go to capital contributors.

                                            Ultimately we want the roadmap to be prioritized by the community. However we believe many 
                                            projects that attempt democracy too early end in unescapable conflict that destroys the project.
                                            Instead we will drive the project forward until the time when external contributions outweigh our own.

                                            The first step is to build a platform that can perform basic crypto functions.
                                            As we develop those basic functions we build out tooling that we share with community.<br><br>
                                            Our vision is that Distributed Public chains is where long term value is held. 
                                            But, private chains like FTT is where useful day to day things happen.<br><Br>
                                            Similar to App-Stores we want to let developers add "Smart Contract" applications to our network.
                                            These can be deployed as hidden addresses, or officially deployed after our quality checks.
                                            <br><Br>
                                            We also have the ability to spin up this blockchain and developer tooling for companies to build internal networks.
                                            We imagine FTT being a hub, with many private chain spokes built on our tech, or built on other tech. 
                                            The key is we connect them to the outside world through our hub.
