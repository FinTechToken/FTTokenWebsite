        What is CryptoPass?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            CryptoPass provides access to all major blockchains & tokens in one place.

    <h3>
        How does CryptoPass work?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            CryptoPass is built on the same cryptography as the Ethereum network. 
            <br><br>
            Your account/keys are stored in one smart contract. 
            With that smart contract you can send transactions to any major blockchain.

    <h3>
        Is CryptoPass secure?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            Yes. All transactions are encrypted clientside with your account/key pair.
            Because encryption happens on the client, your secure data never travels unencrypted over the internet. 
            Your secure data is always encrypted when stored.

    <h3>
        What is the FinTechToken network?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            The FinTechToken network tokenizes all major blockchains.
            You can use the network to transact with major cryptocurrencies with 0 fees at 1 second blocks.
            <br><Br>
            You can also create your own smart contracts using any major cryptocurrencies.

    <h3>
        Is FinTechToken verifiable?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            Yes. We <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fintechtoken.chain/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publish</a> all blocks from the FinTechToken network on S3 every 10 minutes so anyone can verify transactions.

    <h3>
        What is a pass phrase?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            A pass phrase is a group of random words.
            The pass phrase unlocks your CryptoPass. Keep it secret and secure.
            If someone knows or guesses your pass phrase they can use your CryptoPass.

    <h3>
        What if I forget my passphrase?
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span>
            If a passphrase is lost, it is lost forever.
            The most secure thing is to protect your own passphrase.
            <br><Br>
            We offer an optional service to store your passphrase in our digital vault. 
            This way the pass phrase can be recovered.
            We also allow you to name a beneficiary.

<!--
    <strong>What information is needed to create an account?</strong><br>
    None. Blockchain revolutionizes privacy. You can use services without 
    disclosing personal information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>How much does an account cost?</strong><br>
    It's free.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is a blockchain account?</strong><br>
    An account is made up of a public address and a private key. Both are two long strings of charecters.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Address:</strong> This "address" is publicly viewed on the blockchain. If someone wants to send something to you, they use the public address.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Key:</strong> The key is used to encrypt/decrypt blockchain transactions. This must be kept secure because the holder of the key can use the account.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>What is a PassPhrase?</strong><br>
    The PassPhrase is similar to a password. It is used to 
    encrypt your account. You use it when you sign in.
    We suggest using a phrase because 4-5 random words is easier for people to remember
    and almost impossible to crack.
